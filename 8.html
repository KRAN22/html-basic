		<h1 style="color: navy;"> Good Morning! …with a story to read 💕</h1>
		<p style="color:greenyellow;"> The man doesn’t know that there is a snake underneath. The woman doesn’t know that there is a stone crushing the man. </p> 
		<p style="color:red;"> The woman thinks: “I am going to fall! And I can’t climb because the snake is going to bite me! Why can’t the man use a little more strength and pull me up!”</p>
	</div>
	<div style="background-color:yellowgreen;">
		<h1 style="color:aqua;">Bad Story</h1> 
		<p style="color:navy;"> Stop me if you think you’ve heard this one before…

			With a format (and a release schedule) that’s constantly in flux, the one thing you can count on from Bad Story is that Laura Silverman will explore the intersection of addiction recovery, mental health and creativity with exuberance.
