			<p>As the makers of LiveChat, customer service software for businesses, we wanted to provide the community of our customers and live chat agents with a free typing test. This way, they can consistently practice typing and improve their typing skills. We've also made this tool accessible to every visitor of our page. Our tool is a free typing speed test with a WPM score, but it can be also used as a typing speed test for kids.

			<p> The CPM stands for the number of characters you type per minute, including all the mistakes. “Corrected” scores count only correctly typed words. WPM is just the corrected CPM divided by five. This is the de facto international standard.</p>
